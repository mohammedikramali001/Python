# Build automation tools
---
### What are some build automation tools? 
``` 
Gradle, Apache Maven, Apache Ant, Jenkins, Chef, Travis CI, Ansible, Team City, Kubernetes
```
### What are the expected benefits of build automation?
``` 
A properly organized build automation system brings many benefits
* Automated testing
* simplify the delivery of the project across the team.
```
### What are the challenges and problems with implementing build automation?
``` 
The challenges with implementing build automation are:
* Complex Configuration: Setting up build scripts can be complicated and time-consuming.
* Consistency: Ensuring the same build process across different environments is challenging.
* Maintenance: Ongoing updates and changes to the build process require effort.
* Testing: Verifying builds for all possible scenarios can be difficult.
* Integration: Coordinating multiple tools and systems can lead to issues.

## Topic: Test Automation

### What are some test automation tools?
``` 
* Selenium: For web application testing, Selenium is widely used. It supports various programming languages and browsers.
* Appium: A popular choice for mobile app testing, supporting both Android and iOS.
* Jenkins: Primarily a continuous integration tool, Jenkins also offers test automation capabilities.
* JUnit: A Java-based testing framework for unit tests.
* TestNG: Another Java-based testing framework, TestNG is often used for integration and end-to-end testing.
```
### What are the expected benefits of test automation?
``` 
*Faster Feedback
*Testing Efficiency Improvement
*Earlier Detection of defects.
*Higher overall test coverage.
*Reduced business expense
*Accelerated Result.
*Faster time to market
```
### What are the challenges and problems with implementing test automaton?
``` 
* Sometimes, individual builds run relatively quickly. But in some organizations, there could be dozens or hundreds of builds run in each dev/test cycle. This could be because numerous teams (sometimes thousands of developers) developing different software components, and each running its own build. Or, the dev team might need to deliver numerous versions of the software for different platforms, customized builds for different customers, etc. Some organizations have relatively short builds– but find themselves needing to support dozens, if not hundreds, of these builds at any given time.
* Can become complex as a result of multiple versions and different frameworks  
*  Some organizations have relatively short builds– but find themselves needing to support dozens, if not hundreds, of these builds at any given time.

## Topic: Deployment Automation
### What are some deployment automation tools?
``` 
* jenkins 
* ansible 
* Docker 
* kubernetes 
```
### What are the expected benefits of deployment automation?
``` 
expected benefits of deployment automation:   Speed: It accelerates the deployment process, reducing manual errors and saving time.
Consistency: Ensures consistency in deployment, eliminating variations between different environments.
Reliability: Reduces the risk of human error, making deployments more reliable.
Repeatability: Allows you to reproduce deployments for multiple environments easily.
Scalability: Scales your deployment process to handle larger workloads effortlessly.
```

### What are the challenges and problems with implementing deployment automation?
``` 
2. Integration with Existing Tools:
Integrating build automation with existing version control systems, issue tracker and other development tools can be challenging.
